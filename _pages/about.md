## Research Experience (selected)

**Flexible Electronics-Enabled Fault Detection & 3-D Reconstruction for Soft Robots** — ISURE, University of Notre Dame (Jul 2025 – Aug 2025)  
Advisor: Prof. Tingyu Cheng  
• Engineered flexible sensor arrays that localise actuator faults in real time and enable millimetre-level shape reconstruction of manipulated objects.

**Climbing-Assisted Hand Exoskeleton** — Team ADDLM, SCUT (Feb 2025 – Jun 2025)  
Advisor: Prof. Jingcheng Lei  
• Developed a 448 g glove with passive ratchet locking and series-elastic actuation; locks within 0.18 s and holds 16 N without slip on a 75° climbing rig.

**Real-Time Robotic-Arm Motion Planning from Temporal Logic** — SCUT (Feb 2024 – Present)  
Advisor: Prof. Gang Chen  
• Implementing LCRL-based planners in ROS to guarantee task fulfilment amid dynamic obstacles.

**Offline Voice-Controlled Smart-Home Gateway** — SCUT (Sep 2024 – Jan 2025)  
Advisor: Prof. Zhicong Huang  
• Collected an 8 h Mandarin corpus, trained a 120 k-parameter CNN on MFCC features, and deployed it on a Cortex-M MCU for always-on command recognition (96.2 % accuracy).

**Wine-Quality Prediction with Ensemble Trees** — UCLA (Jun 2024 – Aug 2024)  
Advisor: Prof. Chunyang Liao  
• Proposed a leak-free benchmarking pipeline for five ensemble learners on the Vinho Verde datasets; achieved weighted-F1 0.693 (red) / 0.664 (white).

**Multifunctional Ball-Collecting Robot** — SCUT (Feb 2024 – May 2024)  
Advisor: Prof. Yingjie Zhang  
• Designed a 50 cm³ omnidirectional vehicle that collects balls from ping-pong to basketball via collision funneling; secured a Top-20 % Silver Prize.

**Bionic Water-Strider Robot** — SCUT (Sep 2022 – Jan 2023)  
Advisor: Prof. Ye Chen  
• Built a Chebyshev-linkage swimmer that glides on water and autonomously avoids obstacles using ultrasonic and colour sensing.
