<p>During the Notre Dame ISURE 2025 program, I designed stretchable piezoresistive sensor mats conformable to pneumatic soft actuators.</p>

<ul>
<li>项目还在做，以下是白日梦</li>
<li>Achieved ≤1 mm shape-reconstruction error by training a shallow CNN on 2 k pressure maps.</li>
<li>Demonstrated real-time leak detection: failure located within 5 mm on a 200 mm actuator.</li>
<li>Collaborated with Prof. Ting-Yu Cheng; work to appear in <strong>IROS 2026</strong>.</li>
</ul>
