<p>Designed and built a 50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm vehicle that gathers balls of multiple diameters via collision dynamics—no gripper required.</p>

<ul>
<li>Collision pickup funnels balls into on-board hopper; rear gate servo releases payload.</li>
<li>Four Mecanum wheels driven by 24 V planetary-gear motors enable omni-directional motion; independent spring suspension smooths vibration.</li>
<li>Nylon/aluminium hybrid chassis survives contest impacts; PS2 wireless controller offers intuitive tele-op.</li>
<li>Prototype handles ping-pong to basketballs, stores &gt;15 tennis-ball equivalents, and completes arena run in 45 s; total BOM ≈ ¥3.4 k.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Architecture &amp; Mechanics</h3>

<p>The robot marries a lightweight aluminium-nylon chassis with a four-wheel Mecanum drivetrain. A front impact panel and 35° inclined guide plate transform frontal collisions into vertical lift, allowing balls to roll into a 12-litre hopper. A spring-latched rear gate—driven by a 20 kg·cm digital servo—dumps the payload on command. Independent coil-spring suspensions (1-10 kg rating) mitigate the Mecanum vertical oscillation, protecting battery and control boards.</p>

<h3>Electronics &amp; Control</h3>

<p>The STM32-based C50C controller communicates with dual L298N drivers for the 24 V 1∶51 planetary gear motors. A PS2 wireless pad provides tele-op; speed commands are closed-loop via motor encoders and PID PWM to ensure straight-line tracking (&lt;3 ° deviation over 3 m). The servo gate is mapped to a face button for rapid score drops. A 7.4 V 5200 mAh Li-ion pack sustains &gt;20 min continuous run.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Bench push tests confirm 28 N stall thrust; top planar speed 1.2 m s⁻¹. During the June 2024 college contest the vehicle completed the pick-and-place course in 45 s—30 % faster than baseline—and withstood multiple side impacts without structural damage. Capacity: 6 basketballs or 60 ping-pong balls.</p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Vision module for auto-centred collision trajectory.</li>
<li>Replace nylon side panels with carbon-PETG to shave 180 g.</li>
<li>Upgrade gate servo to magnetic-encoder model for closed-loop throw angle.</li>
</ul>
