Developed and evaluated an LCRL (Linear Temporal Logic with Conditional Reasoning) motion-planning algorithm for a 6-DoF robotic arm.

* Implemented real-time planner in ROS and Gazebo, achieving sub-10 ms replanning latency.
* Integrated perception feedback to handle moving obstacles; success rate â†‘ 18 % compared with RRT* baseline.
* Co-authoring a manuscript on temporal-logic-guided robotic manipulation.
