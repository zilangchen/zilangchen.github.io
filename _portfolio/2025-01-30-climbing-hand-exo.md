Developed a lightweight exoskeleton glove (Feb 2025 – Jun 2025) that locks a climber’s grip within 0.18 s upon slip detection while remaining transparent during free motion.

* Four-layer architecture (sensing, control, actuation, safety) driven by Arduino R3 and HX08L serial servo.
* Thin-film pressure sensors + 3-point-contact algorithm (100 Hz) decide lock/release; bi-directional ratchet ensures power-off safety.
* Spatial four-bar linkage yields 2.5 × mechanical advantage; full glove weight 448 g, total system < 1.5 kg.
* Bench tests: zero slip at 16 N load; climbing-rig trials (75° incline) showed > 90 % successful transitions and instant arrest on deliberate failure.
