During the Notre Dame ISURE 2025 program, I designed stretchable piezoresistive sensor mats conformable to pneumatic soft actuators.

* Achieved â‰¤1 mm shape-reconstruction error by training a shallow CNN on 2 k pressure maps.
* Demonstrated real-time leak detection: failure located within 5 mm on a 200 mm actuator.
* Collaborated with Prof. Ting-Yu Cheng; work to appear in **IROS 2026**.
