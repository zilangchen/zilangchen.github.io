Designed and built a 50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm vehicle that gathers balls of multiple diameters via collision dynamics—no gripper required.

* Collision pickup funnels balls into on-board hopper; rear gate servo releases payload.
* Four Mecanum wheels driven by 24 V planetary-gear motors enable omni-directional motion; independent spring suspension smooths vibration.
* Nylon/aluminium hybrid chassis survives contest impacts; PS2 wireless controller offers intuitive tele-op.
* Prototype handles ping-pong to basketballs, stores >15 tennis-ball equivalents, and completes arena run in 45 s; total BOM ≈ ¥3.4 k.
